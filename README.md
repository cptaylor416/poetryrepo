# STATEMENT

> Each poem integrates two texts, Rainer Maria Wilke's *Collected Poems* and Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*. Each poem contains four sections. The first line (section 1) from one author begins each poem and a line from the other author closes each poem (section 4). A markovifed section (section 2) follows the opening line--the model proportion of the two respective texts are varied in each poem. Then a list is randomly looped containing verbs selected from both original texts by the author (section 3). 

>These texts were selected to represent two extreme ends of a perspective spectrum--romantic, emotional, and stoic, rational--that meet, combine, and integrate in a way that highlights the spectrum--that these "extremes" of perspectives are interact along a spectrum.

# POEMS

**Poem 1**
```
Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
Review again the morals of your wife's body shall issue into the same.
It
 pours
  reaches
   climbs
    sinks
     as if standing on fishes.
```

**Poem 2**
```
Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
The soul, by means of which universal Nature ordains.
It
 pours
  reaches
   climbs
    sinks
     as if standing on fishes.
```

**Poem 3**
```
Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
To the body is but meager measure Of your bright beauty which is coming to be.
It
 pours
  reaches
   climbs
    sinks
     as if standing on fishes.
```

**Poem 4**
```
Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
What am I making of its congenital soul, and all existence; and think that there is least rationality in the 
matter of opinion; and that you are unfit for them?
It
 pours
  reaches
   climbs
    sinks
     as if standing on fishes.
````

**Poem 5**

Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
How easy it is succeeded by another which is of the Universe for all who were once much celebrated now sound 
strangely in our power is good fortune.

     as if standing on fishes.

Nowhere you can go is more peaceful.
As to those that went before, so, too, in life is made new again.
It
